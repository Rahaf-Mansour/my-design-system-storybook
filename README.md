# Design System using Storybook


In this project, I built a button component and showcased the component in the storybook, the component has three different sizes and accepts a color prop with three values, it also has three variants as follows:

- Primary: Has a background that matches the border.
- Secondary: Has a white background with a border that matches the text color.
- Text: Has no background and no outline, it should show an underline when user hover over it.
